<h2>Unceremonious Note:</h2>
As the current project title <b><i>“simple-mariogame--animation-outlook-css”</b><i>itself clarifies: it isn't a complete Mario game. This small project only gives an idea about the CSS animation, and also excites those developers, who loves animation and wish to do a lot more than just a simple animation. This tiny project was engendered during my leisure time and it's only a small attempt for my contributions towards “CSS Animation Community Group” wishing to broaden masses in related tech-field.
